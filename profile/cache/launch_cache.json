In addition to its military space launch mission, Vandenberg Space Force Base also hosts space launches for civil and commercial space entities, such as NASA and SpaceX.", "map_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/location_11_20200803142416.jpg", "timezone_name": "America/Los_Angeles", "total_launch_count": 808, "total_landing_count": 26}, "country_code": "USA", "map_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/pad_8_20200803143300.jpg", "total_launch_count": 9, "orbital_launch_attempt_count": 9}, "infoURLs": [], "vidURLs": [], "webcast_live": false, "timeline": [], "image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/minotaur_iv_lau_image_20240307170209.jpeg", "infographic": null, "program": [], "orbital_launch_attempt_count": 6972, "location_launch_attempt_count": 811, "pad_launch_attempt_count": 10, "agency_launch_attempt_count": 16, "orbital_launch_attempt_count_year": 123, "location_launch_attempt_count_year": 25, "pad_launch_attempt_count_year": 2, "agency_launch_attempt_count_year": 2, "pad_turnaround": "P44DT4H27M", "mission_patches": [], "type": "detailed"}, {"id": "b3f7dd08-1e48-498c-8fcb-193b8d54ed6b", "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/launch/b3f7dd08-1e48-498c-8fcb-193b8d54ed6b/", "slug": "falcon-9-block-5-sirius-sxm-10", "flightclub_url": "https://flightclub.io/result?llId=b3f7dd08-1e48-498c-8fcb-193b8d54ed6b", "r_spacex_api_id": null, "name": "Falcon 9 Block 5 | Sirius SXM-10", "status": {"id": 2, "name": "To Be Determined", "abbrev": "TBD", "description": "Current date is a placeholder or rough estimation based on unreliable or interpreted sources."}, "last_updated": "2025-05-24T11:01:56Z", "updates": [{"id": 10946, "profile_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/profile_images/lucas2520stauder_profile_20230526163835.jpg", "comment": "Updated Pad", "info_url": "https://www.launchphotography.com/Launch_Viewing_Guide.html", "created_by": "hitura-nobad", "created_on": "2025-05-10T16:20:00Z"}, {"id": 10892, "profile_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/profile_images/cosmic2520penguin_profile_20210817212020.png", "comment": "NET June 6.", "info_url": "https://www.launchphotography.com/Launch_Viewing_Guide.html", "created_by": "Cosmic_Penguin", "created_on": "2025-05-04T01:04:00Z"}, {"id": 10133, "profile_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/profile_images/cosmic2520penguin_profile_20210817212020.png", "comment": "Added launch.", "info_url": "https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/els/reports/STA_Print.cfm?mode=current&application_seq=140587&RequestTimeout=1000", "created_by": "Cosmic_Penguin", "created_on": "2025-02-20T02:18:00Z"}], "net": "2025-06-06T00:00:00Z", "net_precision": {"id": 5, "name": "Day", "abbrev": "DAY", "description": "The T-0 is expected on the given day."}, "window_end": "2025-06-06T00:00:00Z", "window_start": "2025-06-06T00:00:00Z", "probability": null, "weather_concerns": null, "holdreason": "", "failreason": "", "hashtag": null, "launch_service_provider": {"id": 121, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/121/", "name": "SpaceX", "featured": true, "type": "Commercial", "country_code": "USA", "abbrev": "SpX", "description": "Space Exploration Technologies Corp., known as SpaceX, is an American aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company headquartered in Hawthorne, California.
