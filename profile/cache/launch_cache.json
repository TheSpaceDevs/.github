In addition to its military space launch mission, Vandenberg Space Force Base also hosts space launches for civil and commercial space entities, such as NASA and SpaceX.", "map_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/location_11_20200803142416.jpg", "timezone_name": "America/Los_Angeles", "total_launch_count": 809, "total_landing_count": 26}, "country_code": "USA", "map_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/pad_16_20200803143532.jpg", "total_launch_count": 195, "orbital_launch_attempt_count": 195}, "infoURLs": [], "vidURLs": [], "webcast_live": false, "timeline": [], "image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/falcon2520925_image_20221009234147.png", "infographic": null, "program": [{"id": 25, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/program/25/", "name": "Starlink", "description": "Starlink is a satellite internet constellation operated by American aerospace company SpaceX", "agencies": [{"id": 121, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/121/", "name": "SpaceX", "type": "Commercial"}], "image_url": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/starlink_program_20231228154508.jpeg", "start_date": "2018-02-22T14:17:00Z", "end_date": null, "info_url": "https://starlink.com", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink", "mission_patches": [{"id": 7, "name": "Space X Starlink Mission Patch", "priority": 10, "image_url": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/mission_patch_images/space2520x252_mission_patch_20221011205756.png", "agency": {"id": 121, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/121/", "name": "SpaceX", "type": "Commercial"}}], "type": {"id": 3, "name": "Communication Constellation"}}], "orbital_launch_attempt_count": 6970, "location_launch_attempt_count": 810, "pad_launch_attempt_count": 196, "agency_launch_attempt_count": 518, "orbital_launch_attempt_count_year": 121, "location_launch_attempt_count_year": 24, "pad_launch_attempt_count_year": 22, "agency_launch_attempt_count_year": 69, "pad_turnaround": "P4DT3H3M45S", "mission_patches": [{"id": 7, "name": "Space X Starlink Mission Patch", "priority": 10, "image_url": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/mission_patch_images/space2520x252_mission_patch_20221011205756.png", "agency": {"id": 121, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/121/", "name": "SpaceX", "type": "Commercial"}}], "type": "detailed"}, {"id": "0c4546c7-80f2-4a0b-8580-f9f62767e326", "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/launch/0c4546c7-80f2-4a0b-8580-f9f62767e326/", "slug": "falcon-9-block-5-starlink-group-12-19", "flightclub_url": "https://flightclub.io/result?llId=0c4546c7-80f2-4a0b-8580-f9f62767e326", "r_spacex_api_id": null, "name": "Falcon 9 Block 5 | Starlink Group 12-19", "status": {"id": 8, "name": "To Be Confirmed", "abbrev": "TBC", "description": "Awaiting official confirmation - current date is known with some certainty."}, "last_updated": "2025-05-28T21:01:54Z", "updates": [{"id": 11084, "profile_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/profile_images/cosmic2520penguin_profile_20210817212020.png", "comment": "Added launch per NOTAMs.", "info_url": "https://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=62940.msg2689006#msg2689006", "created_by": "Cosmic_Penguin", "created_on": "2025-05-27T00:53:00Z"}], "net": "2025-06-02T04:57:00Z", "net_precision": {"id": 2, "name": "Hour", "abbrev": "HR", "description": "The T-0 is accurate to the hour."}, "window_end": "2025-06-02T08:57:00Z", "window_start": "2025-06-02T04:57:00Z", "probability": null, "weather_concerns": null, "holdreason": "", "failreason": "", "hashtag": null, "launch_service_provider": {"id": 121, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/121/", "name": "SpaceX", "featured": true, "type": "Commercial", "country_code": "USA", "abbrev": "SpX", "description": "Space Exploration Technologies Corp., known as SpaceX, is an American aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company headquartered in Hawthorne, California.

In addition to its military space launch mission, Vandenberg Space Force Base also hosts space launches for civil and commercial space entities, such as NASA and SpaceX.", "map_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/location_11_20200803142416.jpg", "timezone_name": "America/Los_Angeles", "total_launch_count": 809, "total_landing_count": 26}, "country_code": "USA", "map_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/pad_16_20200803143532.jpg", "total_launch_count": 195, "orbital_launch_attempt_count": 195}, "infoURLs": [], "vidURLs": [], "webcast_live": false, "timeline": [], "image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/falcon2520925_image_20221009234147.png", "infographic": null, "program": [{"id": 25, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/program/25/", "name": "Starlink", "description": "Starlink is a satellite internet constellation operated by American aerospace company SpaceX", "agencies": [{"id": 121, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/121/", "name": "SpaceX", "type": "Commercial"}], "image_url": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/starlink_program_20231228154508.jpeg", "start_date": "2018-02-22T14:17:00Z", "end_date": null, "info_url": "https://starlink.com", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink", "mission_patches": [{"id": 7, "name": "Space X Starlink Mission Patch", "priority": 10, "image_url": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/mission_patch_images/space2520x252_mission_patch_20221011205756.png", "agency": {"id": 121, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/121/", "name": "SpaceX", "type": "Commercial"}}], "type": {"id": 3, "name": "Communication Constellation"}}], "orbital_launch_attempt_count": 6973, "location_launch_attempt_count": 811, "pad_launch_attempt_count": 197, "agency_launch_attempt_count": 520, "orbital_launch_attempt_count_year": 124, "location_launch_attempt_count_year": 25, "pad_launch_attempt_count_year": 23, "agency_launch_attempt_count_year": 71, "pad_turnaround": "P3DT3H49M", "mission_patches": [{"id": 7, "name": "Space X Starlink Mission Patch", "priority": 10, "image_url": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/mission_patch_images/space2520x252_mission_patch_20221011205756.png", "agency": {"id": 121, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/121/", "name": "SpaceX", "type": "Commercial"}}], "type": "detailed"}, {"id": "b3f7dd08-1e48-498c-8fcb-193b8d54ed6b", "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/launch/b3f7dd08-1e48-498c-8fcb-193b8d54ed6b/", "slug": "falcon-9-block-5-sirius-sxm-10", "flightclub_url": "https://flightclub.io/result?llId=b3f7dd08-1e48-498c-8fcb-193b8d54ed6b", "r_spacex_api_id": null, "name": "Falcon 9 Block 5 | Sirius SXM-10", "status": {"id": 8, "name": "To Be Confirmed", "abbrev": "TBC", "description": "Awaiting official confirmation -
