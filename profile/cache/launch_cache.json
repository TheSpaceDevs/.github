In addition to its military space launch mission, Vandenberg Space Force Base also hosts space launches for civil and commercial space entities, such as NASA and SpaceX.", "map_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/location_11_20200803142416.jpg", "timezone_name": "America/Los_Angeles", "total_launch_count": 850, "total_landing_count": 30}, "country_code": "USA", "map_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/pad_16_20200803143532.jpg", "total_launch_count": 236, "orbital_launch_attempt_count": 236}, "infoURLs": [{"priority": 10, "source": "spacex.com", "title": "SpaceX", "description": "SpaceX designs, manufactures and launches advanced rockets and spacecraft.
