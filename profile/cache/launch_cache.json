In addition to its military space launch mission, Vandenberg Space Force Base also hosts space launches for civil and commercial space entities, such as NASA and SpaceX.", "map_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/location_11_20200803142416.jpg", "timezone_name": "America/Los_Angeles", "total_launch_count": 776, "total_landing_count": 21}, "country_code": "USA", "map_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/pad_16_20200803143532.jpg", "total_launch_count": 164, "orbital_launch_attempt_count": 164}, "infoURLs": [], "vidURLs": [], "webcast_live": false, "timeline": [], "image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/falcon2520925_image_20221009234147.png", "infographic": null, "program": [{"id": 25, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/program/25/", "name": "Starlink", "description": "Starlink is a satellite internet constellation operated by American aerospace company SpaceX", "agencies": [{"id": 121, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/121/", "name": "SpaceX", "type": "Commercial"}], "image_url": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/starlink_program_20231228154508.jpeg", "start_date": "2018-02-22T14:17:00Z", "end_date": null, "info_url": "https://starlink.com", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink", "mission_patches": [{"id": 7, "name": "Space X Starlink Mission Patch", "priority": 10, "image_url": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/mission_patch_images/space2520x252_mission_patch_20221011205756.png", "agency": {"id": 121, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/121/", "name": "SpaceX", "type": "Commercial"}}], "type": {"id": 3, "name": "Communication Constellation"}}], "orbital_launch_attempt_count": 6802, "location_launch_attempt_count": 778, "pad_launch_attempt_count": 166, "agency_launch_attempt_count": 426, "orbital_launch_attempt_count_year": 213, "location_launch_attempt_count_year": 39, "pad_launch_attempt_count_year": 38, "agency_launch_attempt_count_year": 115, "pad_turnaround": "P4DT22H5M", "mission_patches": [{"id": 7, "name": "Space X Starlink Mission Patch", "priority": 10, "image_url": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/mission_patch_images/space2520x252_mission_patch_20221011205756.png", "agency": {"id": 121, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/121/", "name": "SpaceX", "type": "Commercial"}}], "type": "detailed"}, {"id": "1d186a4d-734e-4d45-a4cd-ae8da62f0c5c", "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/launch/1d186a4d-734e-4d45-a4cd-ae8da62f0c5c/", "slug": "long-march-4c-unknown-payload", "flightclub_url": null, "r_spacex_api_id": null, "name": "Long March 4C | Unknown Payload", "status": {"id": 1, "name": "Go for Launch", "abbrev": "Go", "description": "Current T-0 confirmed by official or reliable sources."}, "last_updated": "2024-11-04T09:27:23Z", "updates": [{"id": 9075, "profile_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/profile_images/cosmic2520penguin_profile_20210817212020.png", "comment": "Added launch per NOTAMs; Payload and launch vehicle identities very uncertain.", "info_url": "https://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=57867.msg2638697#msg2638697", "created_by": "Cosmic_Penguin", "created_on": "2024-11-04T09:27:00Z"}], "net": "2024-11-13T22:50:00Z", "net_precision": {"id": 2, "name": "Hour", "abbrev": "HR", "description": "The T-0 is accurate to the hour."}, "window_end": "2024-11-13T23:07:00Z", "window_start": "2024-11-13T22:34:00Z", "probability": null, "weather_concerns": null, "holdreason": "", "failreason": "", "hashtag": null, "launch_service_provider": {"id": 88, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/88/", "name": "China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation", "featured": true, "type": "Government", "country_code": "CHN", "abbrev": "CASC", "description": "The China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) is the main contractor for the Chinese space program.
