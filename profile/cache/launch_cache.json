Located on the east coast of Florida, KSC is adjacent to Cape Canaveral Space Force Station (CCSFS).", "map_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/location_27_20200803142447.jpg", "timezone_name": "America/New_York", "total_launch_count": 258, "total_landing_count": 0}, "country_code": "USA", "map_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/pad_87_20200803143537.jpg", "total_launch_count": 200, "orbital_launch_attempt_count": 199}, "infoURLs": [], "vidURLs": [], "webcast_live": false, "timeline": [], "image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/falcon2520925_image_20220301072106.jpeg", "infographic": null, "program": [{"id": 5, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/program/5/", "name": "Commercial Crew Program", "description": "The Commercial Crew Program (CCP) is a human spaceflight program operated by NASA, in association with American aerospace manufacturers Boeing and SpaceX.
