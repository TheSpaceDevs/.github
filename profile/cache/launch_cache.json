In addition to its military space launch mission, Vandenberg Space Force Base also hosts space launches for civil and commercial space entities, such as NASA and SpaceX.", "map_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/location_11_20200803142416.jpg", "timezone_name": "America/Los_Angeles", "total_launch_count": 796, "total_landing_count": 26}, "country_code": "USA", "map_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/pad_39_20200803143542.jpg", "total_launch_count": 97, "orbital_launch_attempt_count": 97}, "infoURLs": [], "vidURLs": [], "webcast_live": false, "timeline": [], "image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/firefly_alpha_l_image_20240605174156.jpeg", "infographic": null, "program": [], "orbital_launch_attempt_count": 6912, "location_launch_attempt_count": 797, "pad_launch_attempt_count": 98, "agency_launch_attempt_count": 6, "orbital_launch_attempt_count_year": 63, "location_launch_attempt_count_year": 11, "pad_launch_attempt_count_year": 1, "agency_launch_attempt_count_year": 1, "pad_turnaround": "P265DT9H33M", "mission_patches": [{"id": 1104, "name": "Firefly_Alpha_FLTA006_Message_In_A_Booster", "priority": 10, "image_url": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/mission_patch_images/firefly_alpha_f_mission_patch_20250306021655.webp", "agency": null}], "type": "detailed"}, {"id": "94b4e77e-ac83-4b4b-8508-0443bd8bdecf", "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/launch/94b4e77e-ac83-4b4b-8508-0443bd8bdecf/", "slug": "electron-finding-hot-wildfires-near-you-ororatech", "flightclub_url": null, "r_spacex_api_id": null, "name": "Electron | Finding Hot Wildfires Near You (OroraTech OTC-P1)", "status": {"id": 1, "name": "Go for Launch", "abbrev": "Go", "description": "Current T-0 confirmed by official or reliable sources."}, "last_updated": "2025-03-20T09:39:25Z", "updates": [{"id": 10508, "profile_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/profile_images/cosmic2520penguin_profile_20210817212020.png", "comment": "Changed NET launch date.", "info_url": "https://www.rocketlabusa.com/assets/Uploads/F63-OroraTech-presskit.pdf", "created_by": "Cosmic_Penguin", "created_on": "2025-03-20T09:39:00Z"}, {"id": 10507, "profile_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/profile_images/cosmic2520penguin_profile_20210817212020.png", "comment": "Added launch window and launch pad information.", "info_url": "https://www.rocketlabusa.com/assets/Uploads/FINAL-F63-OroraTech2.pdf", "created_by": "Cosmic_Penguin", "created_on": "2025-03-20T03:02:00Z"}, {"id": 10494, "profile_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/profile_images/cosmic2520penguin_profile_20210817212020.png", "comment": "GO for launch.", "info_url": "https://x.com/rocketlab/status/1902093950393217216", "created_by": "Cosmic_Penguin", "created_on": "2025-03-18T20:27:00Z"}, {"id": 9866, "profile_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/profile_images/cosmic2520penguin_profile_20210817212020.png", "comment": "Added launch.", "info_url": "https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-to-launch-global-wildfire-detection-and-monitoring-mission-for-ororatech-2/", "created_by": "Cosmic_Penguin", "created_on": "2025-01-23T03:07:00Z"}], "net": "2025-03-26T15:30:00Z", "net_precision": {"id": 1, "name": "Minute", "abbrev": "MIN", "description": "The T-0 is accurate to the minute."}, "window_end": "2025-03-26T16:00:00Z", "window_start": "2025-03-26T15:30:00Z", "probability": null, "weather_concerns": null, "holdreason": "", "failreason": "", "hashtag": null, "launch_service_provider": {"id": 147, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/147/", "name": "Rocket Lab", "featured": true, "type": "Commercial", "country_code": "USA", "abbrev": "RL", "description": "Rocket Lab is an American aerospace manufacturer with a wholly owned New Zealand subsidiary.

In addition to its military space launch mission, Vandenberg Space Force Base also hosts space launches for civil and commercial space entities, such as NASA and SpaceX.", "map_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/location_11_20200803142416.jpg", "timezone_name": "America/Los_Angeles", "total_launch_count": 796, "total_landing_count": 26}, "country_code": "USA", "map_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/pad_16_20200803143532.jpg", "total_launch_count": 184, "orbital_launch_attempt_count": 184}, "infoURLs": [], "vidURLs": [], "webcast_live": false, "timeline": [], "image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/falcon2520925_image_20221009234147.png", "infographic": null, "program": [{"id": 25, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/program/25/", "name": "Starlink", "description": "Starlink is a satellite internet constellation operated by American aerospace company SpaceX", "agencies": [{"id": 121, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/121/", "name": "SpaceX", "type": "Commercial"}], "image_url": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/starlink_program_20231228154508.jpeg", "start_date": "2018-02-22T14:17:00Z", "end_date": null, "info_url": "https://starlink.com", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink", "mission_patches": [{"id": 7, "name": "Space X Starlink Mission Patch", "priority": 10, "image_url": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/mission_patch_images/space2520x252_mission_patch_20221011205756.png", "agency": {"id": 121, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/121/", "name": "SpaceX", "type": "Commercial"}}], "type": {"id": 3, "name": "Communication Constellation"}}], "orbital_launch_attempt_count": 6915, "location_launch_attempt_count": 798, "pad_launch_attempt_count": 185, "agency_launch_attempt_count": 486, "orbital_launch_attempt_count_year": 66, "location_launch_attempt_count_year": 12, "pad_launch_attempt_count_year": 11, "agency_launch_attempt_count_year": 37, "pad_turnaround": "P5DT15H11M", "mission_patches": [{"id": 7, "name": "Space X Starlink Mission Patch", "priority": 10, "image_url": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/mission_patch_images/space2520x252_mission_patch_20221011205756.png", "agency": {"id": 121, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/121/", "name": "SpaceX", "type": "Commercial"}}], "type": "detailed"}, {"id": "a0058cfb-c868-44b6-82cb-7f4ed286b272", "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/launch/a0058cfb-c868-44b6-82cb-7f4ed286b272/", "slug": "falcon-9-block-5-starlink-group-6-80", "flightclub_url": "https://flightclub.io/result?llId=a0058cfb-c868-44b6-82cb-7f4ed286b272", "r_spacex_api_id": null, "name": "Falcon 9 Block 5 | Starlink Group 6-80", "status": {"id": 8, "name": "To Be Confirmed", "abbrev": "TBC", "description": "Awaiting official confirmation - current date is known with some certainty."}, "last_updated": "2025-03-23T23:02:20Z", "updates": [{"id": 10519, "profile_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/profile_images/cosmic2520penguin_profile_20210817212020.png", "comment": "Added launch.", "info_url": "https://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=62643.msg2673732#msg2673732", "created_by": "Cosmic_Penguin", "created_on": "2025-03-21T13:30:00Z"}], "net": "2025-03-30T19:16:00Z", "net_precision": {"id": 2, "name": "Hour", "abbrev": "HR", "description": "The T-0 is accurate to the hour."}, "window_end": "2025-03-30T23:45:00Z", "window_start": "2025-03-30T19:16:00Z", "probability": null, "weather_concerns": null, "holdreason": "", "failreason": "", "hashtag": null, "launch_service_provider": {"id": 121, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/121/", "name": "SpaceX", "featured": true, "type": "Commercial", "country_code": "USA", "abbrev": "SpX", "description": "Space Exploration Technologies Corp., known as SpaceX, is an American aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company headquartered in Hawthorne, California.
