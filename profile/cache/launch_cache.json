With the Electron launch of 21 January 2018, it became the first private spaceport to host a successful orbital launch.", "map_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/location_10_20200803142509.jpg", "timezone_name": "Pacific/Auckland", "total_launch_count": 65, "total_landing_count": 17}, "country_code": "NZL", "map_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/pad_185_20200803143540.jpg", "total_launch_count": 31, "orbital_launch_attempt_count": 31}, "infoURLs": [{"priority": 10, "source": null, "title": null, "description": null, "feature_image": null, "url": "https://rocketlabcorp.com/assets/Uploads/RL-F74-The-Nation-God-Navigates-Presskit.pdf", "type": {"id": 2, "name": "Official Press Kit"}, "language": {"id": 1, "name": "English", "code": "en"}}], "vidURLs": [], "webcast_live": false, "timeline": [{"type": {"id": 6, "abbrev": "Startup", "description": "The onboard computer takes control over the countdown and runs last checks"}, "relative_time": "-PT2M"}, {"type": {"id": 9, "abbrev": "Ignition", "description": "Start of the engine ignition sequence"}, "relative_time": "-PT2S"}, {"type": {"id": 10, "abbrev": "Liftoff", "description": "First upwards movement of the rocket"}, "relative_time": "P0D"}, {"type": {"id": 25, "abbrev": "Supersonic", "description": "Vehicle is supersonic"}, "relative_time": "PT56S"}, {"type": {"id": 11, "abbrev": "Max-Q", "description": "Maximum dynamic pressure"}, "relative_time": "PT1M8S"}, {"type": {"id": 12, "abbrev": "MECO", "description": "Cut-off of the main engine"}, "relative_time": "PT2M30S"}, {"type": {"id": 13, "abbrev": "Stage 2 Separation", "description": "Separation of the second stage from the first"}, "relative_time": "PT2M34S"}, {"type": {"id": 31, "abbrev": "SES", "description": "Start of the second engine"}, "relative_time": "PT2M47S"}, {"type": {"id": 15, "abbrev": "Fairing Separation", "description": "Separation of the payload fairing"}, "relative_time": "PT3M10S"}, {"type": {"id": 72, "abbrev": "Battery Hotswap", "description": "Electron Second stages switches to a new set of batteries and jettisons the depleted ones."}, "relative_time": "PT6M29S"}, {"type": {"id": 24, "abbrev": "SECO", "description": "Cut-off of the second engine"}, "relative_time": "PT9M4S"}, {"type": {"id": 30, "abbrev": "Kick Stage Separation", "description": "Separation of the kick stage from the previous stage"}, "relative_time": "PT9M9S"}, {"type": {"id": 32, "abbrev": "Kick Stage Ignition", "description": "Start of the kick stage engine"}, "relative_time": "PT46M34S"}, {"type": {"id": 33, "abbrev": "Kick Stage Cut-off", "description": "Cut-off of the kick stage engine"}, "relative_time": "PT49M25S"}, {"type": {"id": 35, "abbrev": "Payload Separation", "description": "Final deployment of the payload from the rocket"}, "relative_time": "PT50M16S"}], "image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/electron_image_20190705175640.jpeg", "infographic": null, "program": [], "orbital_launch_attempt_count": 7108, "location_launch_attempt_count": 66, "pad_launch_attempt_count": 32, "agency_launch_attempt_count": 74, "orbital_launch_attempt_count_year": 259, "location_launch_attempt_count_year": 14, "pad_launch_attempt_count_year": 7, "agency_launch_attempt_count_year": 16, "pad_turnaround": "P92DT15H35M", "mission_patches": [{"id": 1193, "name": "F76-RL-iQPS-NationGod-Patch", "priority": 10, "image_url": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/mission_patch_images/f76-rl-iqps-nat_mission_patch_20251021014208.png", "agency": {"id": 147, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/147/", "name": "Rocket Lab", "type": "Commercial"}}], "type": "detailed"}]}
