In addition to its military space launch mission, Vandenberg Space Force Base also hosts space launches for civil and commercial space entities, such as NASA and SpaceX.", "map_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/location_11_20200803142416.jpg", "timezone_name": "America/Los_Angeles", "total_launch_count": 788, "total_landing_count": 23}, "country_code": "USA", "map_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/pad_16_20200803143532.jpg", "total_launch_count": 176, "orbital_launch_attempt_count": 176}, "infoURLs": [], "vidURLs": [], "webcast_live": false, "timeline": [], "image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/falcon2520925_image_20221009234147.png", "infographic": null, "program": [{"id": 25, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/program/25/", "name": "Starlink", "description": "Starlink is a satellite internet constellation operated by American aerospace company SpaceX", "agencies": [{"id": 121, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/121/", "name": "SpaceX", "type": "Commercial"}], "image_url": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/starlink_program_20231228154508.jpeg", "start_date": "2018-02-22T14:17:00Z", "end_date": null, "info_url": "https://starlink.com", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink", "mission_patches": [{"id": 7, "name": "Space X Starlink Mission Patch", "priority": 10, "image_url": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/mission_patch_images/space2520x252_mission_patch_20221011205756.png", "agency": {"id": 121, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/121/", "name": "SpaceX", "type": "Commercial"}}], "type": {"id": 3, "name": "Communication Constellation"}}], "orbital_launch_attempt_count": 6864, "location_launch_attempt_count": 790, "pad_launch_attempt_count": 178, "agency_launch_attempt_count": 461, "orbital_launch_attempt_count_year": 15, "location_launch_attempt_count_year": 4, "pad_launch_attempt_count_year": 4, "agency_launch_attempt_count_year": 12, "pad_turnaround": "P3DT22H41M", "mission_patches": [{"id": 7, "name": "Space X Starlink Mission Patch", "priority": 10, "image_url": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/mission_patch_images/space2520x252_mission_patch_20221011205756.png", "agency": {"id": 121, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/121/", "name": "SpaceX", "type": "Commercial"}}], "type": "detailed"}, {"id": "4571a6a4-5d5b-4126-ba16-65d4581e7d73", "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/launch/4571a6a4-5d5b-4126-ba16-65d4581e7d73/", "slug": "falcon-9-block-5-starlink-group-10-12", "flightclub_url": null, "r_spacex_api_id": null, "name": "Falcon 9 Block 5 | Starlink Group 10-12", "status": {"id": 8, "name": "To Be Confirmed", "abbrev": "TBC", "description": "Awaiting official confirmation - current date is known with some certainty."}, "last_updated": "2025-01-16T18:21:25Z", "updates": [{"id": 9825, "profile_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/profile_images/cosmic2520penguin_profile_20210817212020.png", "comment": "Added launch.", "info_url": "https://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=62221.msg2656668#msg2656668", "created_by": "Cosmic_Penguin", "created_on": "2025-01-16T18:21:00Z"}], "net": "2025-01-24T22:45:00Z", "net_precision": {"id": 2, "name": "Hour", "abbrev": "HR", "description": "The T-0 is accurate to the hour."}, "window_end": "2025-01-25T03:15:00Z", "window_start": "2025-01-24T22:45:00Z", "probability": null, "weather_concerns": null, "holdreason": "", "failreason": "", "hashtag": null, "launch_service_provider": {"id": 121, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/121/", "name": "SpaceX", "featured": true, "type": "Commercial", "country_code": "USA", "abbrev": "SpX", "description": "Space Exploration Technologies Corp., known as SpaceX, is an American aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company headquartered in Hawthorne, California.
