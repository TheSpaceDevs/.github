In addition to its military space launch mission, Vandenberg Space Force Base also hosts space launches for civil and commercial space entities, such as NASA and SpaceX.", "map_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/location_11_20200803142416.jpg", "timezone_name": "America/Los_Angeles", "total_launch_count": 778, "total_landing_count": 21}, "country_code": "USA", "map_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/pad_16_20200803143532.jpg", "total_launch_count": 166, "orbital_launch_attempt_count": 166}, "infoURLs": [], "vidURLs": [], "webcast_live": false, "timeline": [], "image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/falcon2520925_image_20221009234147.png", "infographic": null, "program": [{"id": 25, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/program/25/", "name": "Starlink", "description": "Starlink is a satellite internet constellation operated by American aerospace company SpaceX", "agencies": [{"id": 121, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/121/", "name": "SpaceX", "type": "Commercial"}], "image_url": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/starlink_program_20231228154508.jpeg", "start_date": "2018-02-22T14:17:00Z", "end_date": null, "info_url": "https://starlink.com", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink", "mission_patches": [{"id": 7, "name": "Space X Starlink Mission Patch", "priority": 10, "image_url": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/mission_patch_images/space2520x252_mission_patch_20221011205756.png", "agency": {"id": 121, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/121/", "name": "SpaceX", "type": "Commercial"}}], "type": {"id": 3, "name": "Communication Constellation"}}], "orbital_launch_attempt_count": 6806, "location_launch_attempt_count": 779, "pad_launch_attempt_count": 167, "agency_launch_attempt_count": 428, "orbital_launch_attempt_count_year": 217, "location_launch_attempt_count_year": 40, "pad_launch_attempt_count_year": 39, "agency_launch_attempt_count_year": 117, "pad_turnaround": "P4DT24M", "mission_patches": [{"id": 7, "name": "Space X Starlink Mission Patch", "priority": 10, "image_url": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/mission_patch_images/space2520x252_mission_patch_20221011205756.png", "agency": {"id": 121, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/121/", "name": "SpaceX", "type": "Commercial"}}], "type": "detailed"}, {"id": "a0809bf8-a2f2-48e1-92da-1d8c21180e25", "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/launch/a0809bf8-a2f2-48e1-92da-1d8c21180e25/", "slug": "falcon-9-block-5-gsat-20", "flightclub_url": "https://flightclub.io/result?llId=a0809bf8-a2f2-48e1-92da-1d8c21180e25", "r_spacex_api_id": null, "name": "Falcon 9 Block 5 | GSAT-20", "status": {"id": 8, "name": "To Be Confirmed", "abbrev": "TBC", "description": "Awaiting official confirmation -
