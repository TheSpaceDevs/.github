In addition to its military space launch mission, Vandenberg Space Force Base also hosts space launches for civil and commercial space entities, such as NASA and SpaceX.", "map_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/location_11_20200803142416.jpg", "timezone_name": "America/Los_Angeles", "total_launch_count": 809, "total_landing_count": 26}, "country_code": "USA", "map_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/pad_16_20200803143532.jpg", "total_launch_count": 195, "orbital_launch_attempt_count": 195}, "infoURLs": [], "vidURLs": [], "webcast_live": false, "timeline": [], "image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/falcon2520925_image_20221009234147.png", "infographic": null, "program": [{"id": 25, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/program/25/", "name": "Starlink", "description": "Starlink is a satellite internet constellation operated by American aerospace company SpaceX", "agencies": [{"id": 121, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/121/", "name": "SpaceX", "type": "Commercial"}], "image_url": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/starlink_program_20231228154508.jpeg", "start_date": "2018-02-22T14:17:00Z", "end_date": null, "info_url": "https://starlink.com", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink", "mission_patches": [{"id": 7, "name": "Space X Starlink Mission Patch", "priority": 10, "image_url": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/mission_patch_images/space2520x252_mission_patch_20221011205756.png", "agency": {"id": 121, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/121/", "name": "SpaceX", "type": "Commercial"}}], "type": {"id": 3, "name": "Communication Constellation"}}], "orbital_launch_attempt_count": 6971, "location_launch_attempt_count": 810, "pad_launch_attempt_count": 196, "agency_launch_attempt_count": 518, "orbital_launch_attempt_count_year": 122, "location_launch_attempt_count_year": 24, "pad_launch_attempt_count_year": 22, "agency_launch_attempt_count_year": 69, "pad_turnaround": "P3DT4H10M", "mission_patches": [{"id": 7, "name": "Space X Starlink Mission Patch", "priority": 10, "image_url": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/mission_patch_images/space2520x252_mission_patch_20221011205756.png", "agency": {"id": 121, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/121/", "name": "SpaceX", "type": "Commercial"}}], "type": "detailed"}, {"id": "e5969a95-6498-42ff-835f-e685ec75791b", "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/launch/e5969a95-6498-42ff-835f-e685ec75791b/", "slug": "new-shepard-ns-32", "flightclub_url": null, "r_spacex_api_id": null, "name": "New Shepard | NS-32", "status": {"id": 1, "name": "Go for Launch", "abbrev": "Go", "description": "Current T-0 confirmed by official or reliable sources."}, "last_updated": "2025-05-27T16:28:59Z", "updates": [{"id": 11085, "profile_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/profile_images/cosmic2520penguin_profile_20210817212020.png", "comment": "GO for launch.", "info_url": "https://x.com/blueorigin/status/1927394552588992914", "created_by": "Cosmic_Penguin", "created_on": "2025-05-27T16:28:00Z"}, {"id": 11061, "profile_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/profile_images/cosmic2520penguin_profile_20210817212020.png", "comment": "Added launch.", "info_url": "https://www.blueorigin.com/news/new-shepard-ns-32-mission", "created_by": "Cosmic_Penguin", "created_on": "2025-05-23T04:40:00Z"}], "net": "2025-05-31T13:30:00Z", "net_precision": {"id": 1, "name": "Minute", "abbrev": "MIN", "description": "The T-0 is accurate to the minute."}, "window_end": "2025-05-31T13:30:00Z", "window_start": "2025-05-31T13:30:00Z", "probability": null, "weather_concerns": null, "holdreason": "", "failreason": "", "hashtag": null, "launch_service_provider": {"id": 141, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/141/", "name": "Blue Origin", "featured": true, "type": "Commercial", "country_code": "USA", "abbrev": "BO", "description": "Blue Origin is an American privately funded aerospace manufacturer and spaceflight services company set up by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos with its headquarters in Kent, Washington.
