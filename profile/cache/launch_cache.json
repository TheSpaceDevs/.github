In addition to its military space launch mission, Vandenberg Space Force Base also hosts space launches for civil and commercial space entities, such as NASA and SpaceX.", "map_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/location_11_20200803142416.jpg", "timezone_name": "America/Los_Angeles", "total_launch_count": 849, "total_landing_count": 30}, "country_code": "USA", "map_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/pad_16_20200803143532.jpg", "total_launch_count": 235, "orbital_launch_attempt_count": 235}, "infoURLs": [{"priority": 10, "source": "spacex.com", "title": "SpaceX", "description": "SpaceX designs, manufactures and launches advanced rockets and spacecraft.

In addition to its military space launch mission, Vandenberg Space Force Base also hosts space launches for civil and commercial space entities, such as NASA and SpaceX.", "map_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/location_11_20200803142416.jpg", "timezone_name": "America/Los_Angeles", "total_launch_count": 849, "total_landing_count": 30}, "country_code": "USA", "map_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/pad_16_20200803143532.jpg", "total_launch_count": 235, "orbital_launch_attempt_count": 235}, "infoURLs": [{"priority": 10, "source": "spacex.com", "title": "SpaceX", "description": "SpaceX designs, manufactures and launches advanced rockets and spacecraft.
