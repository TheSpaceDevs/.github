In addition to its military space launch mission, Vandenberg Space Force Base also hosts space launches for civil and commercial space entities, such as NASA and SpaceX.", "map_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/location_11_20200803142416.jpg", "timezone_name": "America/Los_Angeles", "total_launch_count": 825, "total_landing_count": 28}, "country_code": "USA", "map_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/pad_16_20200803143532.jpg", "total_launch_count": 211, "orbital_launch_attempt_count": 211}, "infoURLs": [], "vidURLs": [], "webcast_live": false, "timeline": [], "image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/falcon_9_image_20230807133459.jpeg", "infographic": null, "program": [], "orbital_launch_attempt_count": 7052, "location_launch_attempt_count": 828, "pad_launch_attempt_count": 214, "agency_launch_attempt_count": 566, "orbital_launch_attempt_count_year": 203, "location_launch_attempt_count_year": 42, "pad_launch_attempt_count_year": 40, "agency_launch_attempt_count_year": 117, "pad_turnaround": "P6DT21H27M", "mission_patches": [], "type": "detailed"}, {"id": "d4813e5c-305e-4401-ba4f-917aa1aaceae", "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/launch/d4813e5c-305e-4401-ba4f-917aa1aaceae/", "slug": "soyuz-21a-progress-ms-32-93p", "flightclub_url": null, "r_spacex_api_id": null, "name": "Soyuz 2.1a | Progress MS-32 (93P)", "status": {"id": 8, "name": "To Be Confirmed", "abbrev": "TBC", "description": "Awaiting official confirmation - current date is known with some certainty."}, "last_updated": "2025-05-14T17:06:13Z", "updates": [{"id": 10985, "profile_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/profile_images/cosmic2520penguin_profile_20210817212020.png", "comment": "Added launch time.", "info_url": "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wbFv7DROxC02sx-I1bAjYjOOCFETcPaK/view", "created_by": "Cosmic_Penguin", "created_on": "2025-05-14T17:06:00Z"}, {"id": 9540, "profile_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/profile_images/cosmic2520penguin_profile_20210817212020.png", "comment": "NET September 11.", "info_url": "https://kosmodrom.space/raspisanie-zapuskov", "created_by": "Cosmic_Penguin", "created_on": "2024-12-16T18:33:00Z"}, {"id": 9333, "profile_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/profile_images/cosmic2520penguin_profile_20210817212020.png", "comment": "Added launch.", "info_url": "https://baikonurtour.ru/launches.html", "created_by": "Cosmic_Penguin", "created_on": "2024-11-26T10:09:00Z"}], "net": "2025-09-11T13:49:00Z", "net_precision": {"id": 1, "name": "Minute", "abbrev": "MIN", "description": "The T-0 is accurate to the minute."}, "window_end": "2025-09-11T13:49:00Z", "window_start": "2025-09-11T13:49:00Z", "probability": null, "weather_concerns": null, "holdreason": "", "failreason": "", "hashtag": null, "launch_service_provider": {"id": 63, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/63/", "name": "Russian Federal Space Agency (ROSCOSMOS)", "featured": true, "type": "Government", "country_code": "RUS", "abbrev": "RFSA", "description": "The Roscosmos State Corporation for Space Activities, commonly known as Roscosmos, is the governmental body responsible for the space science program of the Russian Federation and general aerospace research.
