The company is also producing a variety of spacecrafts and spacecrafts components.", "administrator": "CEO: Peter Beck", "founding_year": "2006", "launchers": "Electron", "spacecraft": "", "launch_library_url": null, "total_launch_count": 71, "consecutive_successful_launches": 29, "successful_launches": 66, "failed_launches": 4, "pending_launches": 31, "consecutive_successful_landings": 4, "successful_landings": 7, "failed_landings": 2, "attempted_landings": 9, "info_url": "https://rocketlabcorp.com", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_Lab", "logo_url": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/rocket2520lab2520ltd_logo_20220218075411.png", "image_url": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/rocket2520lab2520ltd_image_20190207032456.jpeg", "nation_url": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/rocket2520lab2520ltd_nation_20230531050352.jpg"}, "program": [], "variant": "", "alias": "", "min_stage": 2, "max_stage": 3, "length": 18.0, "diameter": 1.2, "maiden_flight": "2017-05-25", "launch_cost": "6000000", "launch_mass": 13, "leo_capacity": 300, "gto_capacity": null, "to_thrust": 162, "apogee": null, "vehicle_range": null, "image_url": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/electron_image_20190705175640.jpeg", "info_url": "https://www.rocketlabusa.com/electron/", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_Lab_Electron", "total_launch_count": 71, "consecutive_successful_launches": 29, "successful_launches": 66, "failed_launches": 4, "pending_launches": 29, "attempted_landings": 9, "successful_landings": 7, "failed_landings": 2, "consecutive_successful_landings": 4}, "launcher_stage": [], "spacecraft_stage": null}, "mission": {"id": 7252, "name": "JAKE 4", "description": "Sub-orbital launch under Rocket Lab\u2019s Hypersonic Accelerator Suborbital Test Electron (HASTE) program, details TBD.", "launch_designator": null, "type": "Government/Top Secret", "orbit": {"id": 15, "name": "Suborbital", "abbrev": "Sub"}, "agencies": [], "info_urls": [], "vid_urls": []}, "pad": {"id": 79, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/pad/79/", "agency_id": 147, "name": "Rocket Lab Launch Complex 2 (Launch Area 0 C)", "description": "", "info_url": null, "wiki_url": null, "map_url": "https://www.google.com/maps?q=37.833262,-75.488235", "latitude": "37.833262", "longitude": "-75.488235", "location": {"id": 21, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/location/21/", "name": "Wallops Flight Facility, Virginia, USA", "country_code": "USA", "description": "Wallops Flight Facility is a rocket launch site on Wallops Island on the Eastern Shore of Virginia, United States, just east of the Delmarva Peninsula and north-northeast of Norfolk.
