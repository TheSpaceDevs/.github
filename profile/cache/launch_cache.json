In addition to its military space launch mission, Vandenberg Space Force Base also hosts space launches for civil and commercial space entities, such as NASA and SpaceX.", "map_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/location_11_20200803142416.jpg", "timezone_name": "America/Los_Angeles", "total_launch_count": 793, "total_landing_count": 23}, "country_code": "USA", "map_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/pad_16_20200803143532.jpg", "total_launch_count": 181, "orbital_launch_attempt_count": 181}, "infoURLs": [], "vidURLs": [], "webcast_live": false, "timeline": [], "image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/falcon_9_image_20230807133459.jpeg", "infographic": null, "program": [], "orbital_launch_attempt_count": 6901, "location_launch_attempt_count": 795, "pad_launch_attempt_count": 183, "agency_launch_attempt_count": 482, "orbital_launch_attempt_count_year": 52, "location_launch_attempt_count_year": 9, "pad_launch_attempt_count_year": 9, "agency_launch_attempt_count_year": 33, "pad_turnaround": "P3DT3H28M48S", "mission_patches": [{"id": 761, "name": "SpaceX Transporter Patch v2", "priority": 10, "image_url": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/mission_patch_images/spacex2520tran_mission_patch_20230102202140.png", "agency": {"id": 121, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/121/", "name": "SpaceX", "type": "Commercial"}}], "type": "detailed"}, {"id": "113a85d7-2f1c-4302-a1d5-9b8837ab6a33", "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/launch/113a85d7-2f1c-4302-a1d5-9b8837ab6a33/", "slug": "electron-the-lightning-god-reigns-iqps-launch-1", "flightclub_url": null, "r_spacex_api_id": null, "name": "Electron | The Lightning God Reigns (iQPS Launch 1)", "status": {"id": 1, "name": "Go for Launch", "abbrev": "Go", "description": "Current T-0 confirmed by official or reliable sources."}, "last_updated": "2025-03-09T03:19:20Z", "updates": [{"id": 10363, "profile_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/profile_images/arnaud2520muller_profile_20230607144351.jpg", "comment": "Delayed to March 15 UTC", "info_url": "https://x.com/RocketLab/status/1898572936531026332", "created_by": "Nosu", "created_on": "2025-03-09T03:19:00Z"}, {"id": 10262, "profile_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/profile_images/arnaud2520muller_profile_20230607144351.jpg", "comment": "Adding launch window and mission name, updating pad", "info_url": "https://www.rocketlabusa.com/assets/Uploads/F61-The-Lightning-God-Reigns-press-kit-final.pdf", "created_by": "Nosu", "created_on": "2025-03-03T22:12:00Z"}, {"id": 10225, "profile_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/profile_images/cosmic2520penguin_profile_20210817212020.png", "comment": "NET March.", "info_url": "https://investors.rocketlabusa.com/news/news-details/2025/Rocket-Lab-Signs-Second-Multi-Launch-Deal-Secures-Eight-Electron-Missions-with-iQPS/default.aspx", "created_by": "Cosmic_Penguin", "created_on": "2025-02-27T23:28:00Z"}, {"id": 10016, "profile_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/profile_images/cosmic2520penguin_profile_20210817212020.png", "comment": "Added launch.", "info_url": "https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-signs-multi-launch-contract-with-iqps-for-four-electron-missions/", "created_by": "Cosmic_Penguin", "created_on": "2025-02-05T01:22:00Z"}], "net": "2025-03-15T00:00:00Z", "net_precision": {"id": 1, "name": "Minute", "abbrev": "MIN", "description": "The T-0 is accurate to the minute."}, "window_end": "2025-03-15T02:00:00Z", "window_start": "2025-03-15T00:00:00Z", "probability": null, "weather_concerns": null, "holdreason": "", "failreason": "", "hashtag": null, "launch_service_provider": {"id": 147, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/147/", "name": "Rocket Lab", "featured": true, "type": "Commercial", "country_code": "USA", "abbrev": "RL", "description": "Rocket Lab is an American aerospace manufacturer with a wholly owned New Zealand subsidiary.
