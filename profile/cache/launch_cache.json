In addition to its military space launch mission, Vandenberg Space Force Base also hosts space launches for civil and commercial space entities, such as NASA and SpaceX.", "map_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/location_11_20200803142416.jpg", "timezone_name": "America/Los_Angeles", "total_launch_count": 785, "total_landing_count": 22}, "country_code": "USA", "map_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/pad_16_20200803143532.jpg", "total_launch_count": 173, "orbital_launch_attempt_count": 173}, "infoURLs": [], "vidURLs": [], "webcast_live": false, "timeline": [], "image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/falcon2520925_image_20221009234147.png", "infographic": null, "program": [{"id": 25, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/program/25/", "name": "Starlink", "description": "Starlink is a satellite internet constellation operated by American aerospace company SpaceX", "agencies": [{"id": 121, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/121/", "name": "SpaceX", "type": "Commercial"}], "image_url": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/starlink_program_20231228154508.jpeg", "start_date": "2018-02-22T14:17:00Z", "end_date": null, "info_url": "https://starlink.com", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink", "mission_patches": [{"id": 7, "name": "Space X Starlink Mission Patch", "priority": 10, "image_url": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/mission_patch_images/space2520x252_mission_patch_20221011205756.png", "agency": {"id": 121, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/121/", "name": "SpaceX", "type": "Commercial"}}], "type": {"id": 3, "name": "Communication Constellation"}}], "orbital_launch_attempt_count": 6847, "location_launch_attempt_count": 786, "pad_launch_attempt_count": 174, "agency_launch_attempt_count": 448, "orbital_launch_attempt_count_year": 258, "location_launch_attempt_count_year": 47, "pad_launch_attempt_count_year": 46, "agency_launch_attempt_count_year": 137, "pad_turnaround": "P7DT14H36S", "mission_patches": [{"id": 7, "name": "Space X Starlink Mission Patch", "priority": 10, "image_url": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/mission_patch_images/space2520x252_mission_patch_20221011205756.png", "agency": {"id": 121, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/121/", "name": "SpaceX", "type": "Commercial"}}], "type": "detailed"}, {"id": "644eaa0e-7c09-4be1-980c-ab5c2a07acce", "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/launch/644eaa0e-7c09-4be1-980c-ab5c2a07acce/", "slug": "pslv-ca-spadex-space-docking-experiment", "flightclub_url": null, "r_spacex_api_id": null, "name": "PSLV-CA | SPADEX (Space Docking Experiment)", "status": {"id": 8, "name": "To Be Confirmed", "abbrev": "TBC", "description": "Awaiting official confirmation - current date is known with some certainty."}, "last_updated": "2024-12-21T10:59:33Z", "updates": [{"id": 9610, "profile_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/profile_images/cosmic2520penguin_profile_20210817212020.png", "comment": "Updated launch vehicle variant.", "info_url": "https://www.isro.gov.in/mission_spadex_Gallery.html", "created_by": "Cosmic_Penguin", "created_on": "2024-12-21T10:59:00Z"}, {"id": 9494, "profile_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/profile_images/cosmic2520penguin_profile_20210817212020.png", "comment": "NET December 30 per new NOTAMs.", "info_url": "https://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=42851.msg2648330#msg2648330", "created_by": "Cosmic_Penguin", "created_on": "2024-12-13T15:45:00Z"}, {"id": 9440, "profile_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/profile_images/cosmic2520penguin_profile_20210817212020.png", "comment": "NET December 26.", "info_url": "https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil-nadu/2024/Dec/06/isro-may-test-space-docking-on-december-26", "created_by": "Cosmic_Penguin", "created_on": "2024-12-06T16:55:00Z"}, {"id": 9137, "profile_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/profile_images/cosmic2520penguin_profile_20210817212020.png", "comment": "Targeting December 20.
