In addition to its military space launch mission, Vandenberg Space Force Base also hosts space launches for civil and commercial space entities, such as NASA and SpaceX.", "map_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/location_11_20200803142416.jpg", "timezone_name": "America/Los_Angeles", "total_launch_count": 795, "total_landing_count": 25}, "country_code": "USA", "map_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/pad_16_20200803143532.jpg", "total_launch_count": 183, "orbital_launch_attempt_count": 183}, "infoURLs": [], "vidURLs": [], "webcast_live": false, "timeline": [], "image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/falcon_9_on_slc_image_20241024165956.jpg", "infographic": null, "program": [], "orbital_launch_attempt_count": 6908, "location_launch_attempt_count": 796, "pad_launch_attempt_count": 184, "agency_launch_attempt_count": 484, "orbital_launch_attempt_count_year": 59, "location_launch_attempt_count_year": 10, "pad_launch_attempt_count_year": 10, "agency_launch_attempt_count_year": 35, "pad_turnaround": "P4DT23H19M", "mission_patches": [{"id": 1057, "name": "NROL-146", "priority": 10, "image_url": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/mission_patch_images/nrol-146_mission_patch_20241020111152.png", "agency": {"id": 181, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/181/", "name": "National Reconnaissance Office", "type": "Government"}}], "type": "detailed"}, {"id": "e652a538-6d40-4b55-97a6-7c757ec4e1e9", "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/launch/e652a538-6d40-4b55-97a6-7c757ec4e1e9/", "slug": "spectrum-maiden-flight", "flightclub_url": null, "r_spacex_api_id": null, "name": "Spectrum | Maiden Flight", "status": {"id": 2, "name": "To Be Determined", "abbrev": "TBD", "description": "Current date is a placeholder or rough estimation based on unreliable or interpreted sources."}, "last_updated": "2025-03-14T13:12:46Z", "updates": [{"id": 10434, "profile_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/profile_images/arnaud2520muller_profile_20230607144351.jpg", "comment": "Adding an approximate launch window based on maritime warnings, valid daily from March 20 to 30.", "info_url": "https://europeanspaceflight.com/inaugural-isar-aerospace-spectrum-launch-set-for-late-march/", "created_by": "Nosu", "created_on": "2025-03-14T13:12:00Z"}, {"id": 10432, "profile_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/profile_images/cosmic2520penguin_profile_20210817212020.png", "comment": "NET late March.", "info_url": "https://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=47876.msg2671686#msg2671686", "created_by": "Cosmic_Penguin", "created_on": "2025-03-14T05:29:00Z"}, {"id": 6800, "profile_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/profile_images/cosmic2520penguin_profile_20210817212020.png", "comment": "Added launch.", "info_url": "https://europeanspaceflight.com/isar-aerospace-completes-260-second-hot-fire-test/", "created_by": "Cosmic_Penguin", "created_on": "2024-02-25T13:12:09Z"}], "net": "2025-03-20T12:30:00Z", "net_precision": {"id": 2, "name": "Hour", "abbrev": "HR", "description": "The T-0 is accurate to the hour."}, "window_end": "2025-03-20T16:30:00Z", "window_start": "2025-03-20T12:30:00Z", "probability": null, "weather_concerns": null, "holdreason": "", "failreason": "", "hashtag": null, "launch_service_provider": {"id": 1046, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/1046/", "name": "Isar Aerospace", "featured": false, "type": "Private", "country_code": "DEU", "abbrev": "ISAR", "description": "Isar Aerospace is a German aerospace company based in Munich, Germany.
