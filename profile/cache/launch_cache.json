In addition to its military space launch mission, Vandenberg Space Force Base also hosts space launches for civil and commercial space entities, such as NASA and SpaceX.", "map_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/location_11_20200803142416.jpg", "timezone_name": "America/Los_Angeles", "total_launch_count": 784, "total_landing_count": 21}, "country_code": "USA", "map_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/pad_16_20200803143532.jpg", "total_launch_count": 172, "orbital_launch_attempt_count": 172}, "infoURLs": [], "vidURLs": [], "webcast_live": false, "timeline": [], "image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/falcon_9_image_20230807133459.jpeg", "infographic": null, "program": [], "orbital_launch_attempt_count": 6841, "location_launch_attempt_count": 785, "pad_launch_attempt_count": 173, "agency_launch_attempt_count": 445, "orbital_launch_attempt_count_year": 252, "location_launch_attempt_count_year": 46, "pad_launch_attempt_count_year": 45, "agency_launch_attempt_count_year": 134, "pad_turnaround": "P2DT22H34M", "mission_patches": [], "type": "detailed"}, {"id": "af1466bb-289b-40b3-b83c-102b3a7af047", "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/launch/af1466bb-289b-40b3-b83c-102b3a7af047/", "slug": "electron-owl-the-way-up-strix-launch-6", "flightclub_url": null, "r_spacex_api_id": null, "name": "Electron | Owl The Way Up (StriX Launch 6)", "status": {"id": 1, "name": "Go for Launch", "abbrev": "Go", "description": "Current T-0 confirmed by official or reliable sources."}, "last_updated": "2024-12-19T06:01:48Z", "updates": [{"id": 9581, "profile_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/profile_images/cosmic2520penguin_profile_20210817212020.png", "comment": "Delayed to December 20 UTC due to launch site weather.", "info_url": "https://x.com/rocketlab/status/1869623681586274779", "created_by": "Cosmic_Penguin", "created_on": "2024-12-19T06:01:00Z"}, {"id": 9545, "profile_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/profile_images/cosmic2520penguin_profile_20210817212020.png", "comment": "Delayed to NET December 19 UTC due to launch site weather.", "info_url": "https://x.com/rocketlab/status/1868782997165818018", "created_by": "Cosmic_Penguin", "created_on": "2024-12-17T00:04:00Z"}, {"id": 9471, "profile_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/profile_images/cosmic2520penguin_profile_20210817212020.png", "comment": "Updated launch pad.", "info_url": "https://www.rocketlabusa.com/assets/Uploads/Owl-The-Way-Up-Press-Kit.pdf", "created_by": "Cosmic_Penguin", "created_on": "2024-12-11T02:02:00Z"}, {"id": 9434, "profile_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/profile_images/cosmic2520penguin_profile_20210817212020.png", "comment": "Added launch window.", "info_url": "https://www.rocketlabusa.com/missions/next-mission/", "created_by": "Cosmic_Penguin", "created_on": "2024-12-06T04:58:00Z"}, {"id": 9431, "profile_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/profile_images/lucas2520stauder_profile_20230526163835.jpg", "comment": "NET Dec 17th UTC", "info_url": "https://investors.rocketlabusa.com/news/news-details/2024/Rocket-Lab-Sets-Launch-Window-to-Deploy-Synspective-Satellite/default.aspx", "created_by": "hitura-nobad", "created_on": "2024-12-05T21:40:00Z"}, {"id": 4586, "profile_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/profile_images/arnaud2520muller_profile_20230607144351.jpg", "comment": "Adding launch NET late 2023 or 2024", "info_url": "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230713222764/en/Rocket-Lab-Signs-Multi-Launch-Deal-to-Further-Deploy-Synspective-Constellation", "created_by": "Nosu", "created_on": "2023-07-14T07:24:15Z"}], "net": "2024-12-20T14:00:00Z", "net_precision": {"id": 1, "name": "Minute", "abbrev": "MIN", "description": "The T-0 is accurate to the minute."}, "window_end": "2024-12-20T15:15:00Z", "window_start": "2024-12-20T14:00:00Z", "probability": null, "weather_concerns": null, "holdreason": "", "failreason": "", "hashtag": null, "launch_service_provider": {"id": 147, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/147/", "name": "Rocket Lab", "featured": true, "type": "Commercial", "country_code": "USA", "abbrev": "RL", "description": "Rocket Lab is an American aerospace manufacturer with a wholly owned New Zealand subsidiary.
