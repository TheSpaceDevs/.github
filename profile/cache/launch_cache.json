In addition to its military space launch mission, Vandenberg Space Force Base also hosts space launches for civil and commercial space entities, such as NASA and SpaceX.", "map_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/location_11_20200803142416.jpg", "timezone_name": "America/Los_Angeles", "total_launch_count": 801, "total_landing_count": 26}, "country_code": "USA", "map_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/pad_16_20200803143532.jpg", "total_launch_count": 188, "orbital_launch_attempt_count": 188}, "infoURLs": [], "vidURLs": [], "webcast_live": false, "timeline": [], "image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/falcon_9_on_slc_image_20241024165956.jpg", "infographic": null, "program": [], "orbital_launch_attempt_count": 6930, "location_launch_attempt_count": 802, "pad_launch_attempt_count": 189, "agency_launch_attempt_count": 495, "orbital_launch_attempt_count_year": 81, "location_launch_attempt_count_year": 16, "pad_launch_attempt_count_year": 15, "agency_launch_attempt_count_year": 46, "pad_turnaround": "P6DT22H16M", "mission_patches": [{"id": 1057, "name": "NROL-146", "priority": 10, "image_url": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/mission_patch_images/nrol-146_mission_patch_20241020111152.png", "agency": {"id": 181, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/181/", "name": "National Reconnaissance Office", "type": "Government"}}], "type": "detailed"}, {"id": "6f25718d-40d8-4c74-be30-b70674a0dfb3", "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/launch/6f25718d-40d8-4c74-be30-b70674a0dfb3/", "slug": "falcon-9-block-5-dragon-crs-2-spx-32", "flightclub_url": "https://flightclub.io/result?llId=6f25718d-40d8-4c74-be30-b70674a0dfb3", "r_spacex_api_id": null, "name": "Falcon 9 Block 5 | Dragon CRS-2 SpX-32", "status": {"id": 1, "name": "Go for Launch", "abbrev": "Go", "description": "Current T-0 confirmed by official or reliable sources."}, "last_updated": "2025-04-15T14:58:42Z", "updates": [{"id": 10655, "profile_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/profile_images/arnaud2520muller_profile_20230607144351.jpg", "comment": "Adding seconds to T-0", "info_url": "https://nasa-public-data.s3.amazonaws.com/iss-coords/current/ISS_OEM/ISS.OEM_J2K_EPH.txt", "created_by": "Nosu", "created_on": "2025-04-08T21:22:00Z"}, {"id": 10535, "profile_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/profile_images/cosmic2520penguin_profile_20210817212020.png", "comment": "Adjusted T-0.
