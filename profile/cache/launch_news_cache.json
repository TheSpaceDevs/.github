Looking forward, Falcon 9 could launch up to five launches this week, including the Polaris Dawn mission, whose private crew will conduct an inspiring mission profile. However, that has been delayed due to an unacceptable splashdown forecast. Then, other SpaceX missions include up to three Starlink flights and another set of Starshield satellites to low-Earth orbit (LEO) for the National Reconnaissance Office.", "published_at": "2024-08-27T20:27:46Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-30T21:47:47.843951Z", "featured": false, "launches": [{"launch_id": "b69cfada-3320-4331-89e1-aaa8b49e6a9c", "provider": "Launch Library 2"}, {"launch_id": "95bff87b-38c6-4db0-8b2f-e3952c95f383", "provider": "Launch Library 2"}, {"launch_id": "1bf11245-99d7-4178-8bf8-408730e21b36", "provider": "Launch Library 2"}, {"launch_id": "9a5fe2ad-1089-4b16-bf94-273b0f426741", "provider": "Launch Library 2"}, {"launch_id": "cd042f6b-1b91-4783-b953-79a4a572219d", "provider": "Launch Library 2"}, {"launch_id": "1da9d898-e591-444b-84bf-4bb949b81c62", "provider": "Launch Library 2"}, {"launch_id": "e8c62aa0-6bef-48ac-8ef6-b8589479c6be", "provider": "Launch Library 2"}], "events": []}]
