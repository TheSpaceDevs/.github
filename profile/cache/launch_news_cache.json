The first attempt was stood down last Monday following concerns with a liquid oxygen relief valve on the Centaur second stage. The launch was due to be reattempted this Friday but has since been delayed further with a new target date of May 21 which allows for further testing.\u00a0 It will be the 100th overall mission for the United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket, and the first time the vehicle has carried crew. This CFT mission will also be the first crewed launch from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station since the Apollo era.", "published_at": "2024-05-13T23:01:02Z", "updated_at": "2024-05-14T19:52:08.522797Z", "featured": false, "launches": [{"launch_id": "968067d1-8c12-4018-9854-b7b7d4bddc6b", "provider": "Launch Library 2"}, {"launch_id": "bcab98e3-3650-4733-9d32-47d5870a2151", "provider": "Launch Library 2"}, {"launch_id": "63bb93ea-d77a-4b7e-aca7-325b514e270d", "provider": "Launch Library 2"}, {"launch_id": "791ef5c4-d0f1-4a35-b362-f87aef03621d", "provider": "Launch Library 2"}, {"launch_id": "8bf5f603-cdb5-456c-b266-bbe53f24891d", "provider": "Launch Library 2"}], "events": []}]
