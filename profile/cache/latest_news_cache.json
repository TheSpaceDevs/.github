The spacecraft, christened Odysseus, aims to carry six NASA payloads to Malapert A, a crater near the lunar South Pole. The initial window lasts for three days this month, with all opportunities resulting in a landing on February 22nd; should the launch delay, the next window opens in March. The mission comes soon after the inaugural flight of the CLPS program, Astrobotic\u2019s Peregrine Mission One, which failed to reach the lunar surface following a propellant leak shortly after launch. During a media briefing on Wednesday, January 31st, NASA and Intuitive Machines expressed optimism for the upcoming flight, amidst many questions surrounding the policy of the CLPS initiative as a whole.", "publishedAt": "2024-02-07T15:30:00.000Z", "updatedAt": "2024-02-07T17:20:00.881Z", "featured": false, "launches": [{"id": "942a1814-c237-41de-9970-d27bb9630f3b", "provider": "Launch Library 2"}], "events": []}, {"id": 22503, "title": "Kuva Space establishes U.S. arm in Fairfax, Virginia", "url": "https://spacenews.com/kuva-space-establishes-u-s-arm-in-fairfax-virginia/", "imageUrl": "https://i0.wp.com/spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rsz_kuva_space__hsi_constellation.jpg", "newsSite": "SpaceNews", "summary": "Former Iceye US CEO Jerry Welsh, a Kuva Space US board member, is leading the company\u2019s campaign to provide hyperspectral insights to U.S. government customers.", "publishedAt": "2024-02-07T14:00:00.000Z", "updatedAt": "2024-02-07T14:06:18.762Z", "featured": false, "launches": [], "events": []}, {"id": 22502, "title": "China to launch lunar navigation and communications test satellites", "url": "https://spacenews.com/china-to-launch-lunar-navigation-and-communications-test-satellites/", "imageUrl": "https://i0.wp.com/spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/change5-farside-image.jpg", "newsSite": "SpaceNews", "summary": "China is preparing to launch a pair of Tiandu lunar experimental technology satellites for a planned constellation of satellites to support lunar exploration.", "publishedAt": "2024-02-07T13:17:24.000Z", "updatedAt": "2024-02-07T13:26:19.068Z", "featured": false, "launches": [], "events": []}, {"id": 22501, "title": "Space industry urged to take a broader view of sustainability", "url": "https://spacenews.com/space-industry-urged-to-take-a-broader-view-of-sustainability/", "imageUrl": "https://i0.wp.com/spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/smallsatsymp24-dalbello.jpg", "newsSite": "SpaceNews", "summary": "The space industry need to take a broader examination of issues related to space sustainability that go beyond preventing the growth of space debris, one official says.", "publishedAt": "2024-02-07T13:11:48.000Z", "updatedAt": "2024-02-07T13:16:18.942Z", "featured": false, "launches": [], "events": []}]
