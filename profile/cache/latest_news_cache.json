While Starlink \u2014 along with other satellite \u201cmegaconstellations\u201d \u2014 has been a primary concern for ground-based telescope observations, a new issue has begun to pop up; the satellites are now occasionally obstructing images from one of NASA\u2019s flagship space telescopes, the Hubble Space Telescope. These \u201cphotobombings\u201d point to a concerning future for astronomy in low Earth orbit (LEO), as telescopes in LEO may begin to face the same problems ground-based telescopes face today \u2014 especially as these satellite megaconstellations grow.", "publishedAt": "2023-04-23T20:23:11.000Z", "updatedAt": "2023-04-23T20:25:03.841Z", "featured": false, "launches": [], "events": []}, {"id": 19074, "title": "China may include helicopter in Mars sample return mission", "url": "https://spacenews.com/china-may-include-helicopter-in-mars-sample-return-mission/", "imageUrl": "https://i0.wp.com/spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/zhurong-backshell-parachute-inspection-CNSA-PEC-15july2021-1.jpg", "newsSite": "SpaceNews", "summary": "China could include a helicopter in its Tianwen-3 mission to collect samples from Mars and deliver them to Earth.", "publishedAt": "2023-04-23T15:31:14.000Z", "updatedAt": "2023-04-23T15:34:50.087Z", "featured": false, "launches": [], "events": []}, {"id": 19073, "title": "Astra wins $11.5 million contract to launch military experimental payloads", "url": "https://spacenews.com/astra-wins-11-5-million-contract-to-launch-military-experimental-payloads/", "imageUrl": "https://i0.wp.com/spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-22-at-4.19.44-PM.png", "newsSite": "SpaceNews", "summary": "Astra Space won a task order worth $11.5 million to launch experimental payloads for the Defense Department\u2019s Space Test Program.", "publishedAt": "2023-04-22T23:17:08.000Z", "updatedAt": "2023-04-22T23:24:49.709Z", "featured": false, "launches": [], "events": []}, {"id": 19072, "title": "U.S. military buying SES mPower satcom services under new NATO agreement", "url": "https://spacenews.com/u-s-military-buying-ses-mpower-satcom-services-under-new-nato-agreement/", "imageUrl": "https://i0.wp.com/spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/O3b-mPOWER-Constellation-Rendition-Europe-Middle-East-and-Africa-scaled.jpg", "newsSite": "SpaceNews", "summary": "The U.S. Space Force in its 2024 budget allocated $59 million to buy satellite communications services from SES\u2019 new broadband constellation in medium Earth orbit known as O3b mPower.", "publishedAt": "2023-04-22T20:09:08.000Z", "updatedAt": "2023-04-22T20:14:49.651Z", "featured": false, "launches": [], "events": []}, {"id": 19071, "title": "U.S. Space Force will be the first customer for BlueHalo\u2019s mobile ground station", "url": "https://spacenews.com/u-s-space-force-will-be-the-first-customer-for-bluehalos-mobile-ground-station/", "imageUrl": "https://i0.wp.com/spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_1194-scaled.jpeg", "newsSite": "SpaceNews", "summary": "The U.S. Space Force in 2025 plans to start replacing decades-old parabolic satellite dishes with electronic phased array antennas developed by BlueHalo.", "publishedAt": "2023-04-22T12:18:33.000Z", "updatedAt": "2023-04-22T12:24:50.029Z", "featured": false, "launches": [], "events": []}]
