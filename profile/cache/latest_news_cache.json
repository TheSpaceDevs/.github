During the conference NASA Administrator Bill Nelson highlighted the projected arrival of the sample retrieval lander as 2040\u2014in the same decade currently anticipated for Artemis missions to Mars. This alongside a projected 11 billion dollar price tag and the restrictive budget currently allotted to NASA poses a genuine risk to other science missions.
