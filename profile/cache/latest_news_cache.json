Over a decade after Spitzer\u2019s results were published, the joint NASA, European Space Agency, and Canadian Space Agency James Webb Space Telescope observed SZ Cha and directly detected distinct amounts of neon in the protoplanetary disk of SZ Cha \u2014 confirming Spitzer\u2019s observations from 2008.", "publishedAt": "2023-11-19T22:14:07.000Z", "updatedAt": "2023-11-19T22:19:24.480Z", "featured": false, "launches": [], "events": []}, {"id": 21562, "title": "What\u2019s Happening in Space Policy November 19-December 2, 2023", "url": "https://spacepolicyonline.com/news/whats-happening-in-space-policy-november-19-december-2-2023/", "imageUrl": "https://spacepolicyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Wayne-Hale-SAS-200x300.jpg", "newsSite": "SpacePolicyOnline.com", "summary": "Here is SpacePolicyOnline.com\u2019s list of space policy events for the next TWO weeks, November 19-December 2, 2023 and any insight we can offer about them.
