Notably, IFT-3 successfully achieved the first complete ascent of the combined Starship and Super Heavy system. SpaceX demonstrated several important test objectives during an approximately 40-minute coast phase, but the Starship vehicle was ultimately lost during reentry at the end of the flight. The nominal flight path included only about half of a complete orbit around the Earth; nevertheless, Starship has demonstrated the capability to achieve orbital flight, setting the stage for its test campaign to accelerate in support of its obligations under the Artemis program.", "publishedAt": "2024-03-14T22:30:00.000Z", "updatedAt": "2024-03-15T07:18:17.453Z", "featured": false, "launches": [{"id": "c0d90c60-4961-470a-a6d7-804b3bf4b012", "provider": "Launch Library 2"}], "events": []}, {"id": 22926, "title": "FCC approves direct-to-smartphone regulatory framework", "url": "https://spacenews.com/fcc-approves-direct-to-smartphone-regulatory-framework/", "imageUrl": "https://i0.wp.com/spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/FCC-chair-scaled.jpg", "newsSite": "SpaceNews", "summary": "U.S. regulators have approved ground rules for allowing SpaceX and other satellite operators to use radio waves from terrestrial mobile partners to keep smartphone users connected outside cell tower coverage.", "publishedAt": "2024-03-14T17:26:12.000Z", "updatedAt": "2024-03-14T17:28:49.204Z", "featured": false, "launches": [], "events": []}, {"id": 22925, "title": "Sierra Space developing dual-use spacecraft with military potential", "url": "https://spacenews.com/sierra-space-developing-dual-use-spacecraft-with-military-potential/", "imageUrl": "https://i0.wp.com/spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Sierra-Space-Axelerator-Spectre-LEFT-and-Ghost-RIGHT-scaled.jpg", "newsSite": "SpaceNews", "summary": "With a $1.3 billion defense backlog, the company is eyeing opportunities for in-orbit services and transportation vehicles", "publishedAt": "2024-03-14T17:05:59.000Z", "updatedAt": "2024-03-14T17:08:46.745Z", "featured": false, "launches": [], "events": []}]
