During the conference NASA Administrator Bill Nelson highlighted the projected arrival of the sample retrieval lander as 2040\u2014in the same decade currently anticipated for Artemis missions to Mars. This alongside a projected 11 billion dollar price tag and the restrictive budget currently allotted to NASA poses a genuine risk to other science missions. Both the Dragonfly and NEO Surveyor missions were described as potential targets for \u201ccannibalization\u201d to reserve more resources for an accelerated Mars Sample Return based on the current architecture.", "published_at": "2024-04-16T15:15:00Z", "updated_at": "2024-04-16T15:38:31.660899Z", "featured": false, "launches": [], "events": [{"event_id": 980, "provider": "Launch Library 2"}]}, {"id": 23255, "title": "Russian space chief says new rocket will put Falcon 9 reuse to shame", "url": "https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/04/russian-space-chief-says-new-rocket-will-put-falcon-9-reuse-to-shame/", "image_url": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/borisov.jpg", "news_site": "Arstechnica", "summary": "There's just one catch...", "published_at": "2024-04-16T13:57:44Z", "updated_at": "2024-04-16T14:03:28.295748Z", "featured": false, "launches": [], "events": []}, {"id": 23254, "title": "Switzerland signs Artemis Accords", "url": "https://spacenews.com/switzerland-signs-artemis-accords/", "image_url": "https://i0.wp.com/spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/53656449699_6fe068ef4f_k.jpg", "news_site": "SpaceNews", "summary": "Switzerland formally signed the Artemis Accords April 16, becoming the latest nation to join an agreement about sustainable space exploration.", "published_at": "2024-04-16T11:13:55Z", "updated_at": "2024-04-16T11:23:07.257958Z", "featured": false, "launches": [], "events": []}, {"id": 23250, "title": "Unforgiving Failures: the challenges of upper stages", "url": "https://spacenews.com/unforgiving-failures-the-challenges-of-upper-stages/", "image_url": "https://i0.wp.com/spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/firefly-horizontal-53412390269_af61cd3dc8_k.jpg", "news_site": "SpaceNews", "summary": "Among Western launch vehicles alone there were five partial or complete failures on orbital launches in 2023 (six when counting the second, suborbital test flight of SpaceX\u2019s Starship in November.)", "published_at": "2024-04-16T10:31:20Z", "updated_at": "2024-04-16T10:33:07.796329Z", "featured": false, "launches": [], "events": []}, {"id": 23251, "title": "Can companies clean up by cleaning up space?", "url": "https://spacenews.com/can-companies-clean-up-by-cleaning-up-space/", "image_url": "https://i0.wp.com/spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Cleaning_Up_Space_-copy.jpg", "news_site": "SpaceNews", "summary": "The satellite industry would seem to have nearly a billion reasons to embrace satellite servicing.
