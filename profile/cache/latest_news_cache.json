The rocket will carry a classified payload into orbit for the National Reconnaissance Office. Liftoff is set for 6:13 a.m. EDT (9:13 a.m. EDT; 1313 GMT) Sunday to begin SpaceX\u2019s 14th mission of the year, and the third from Vandenberg, a military base on California\u2019s Central Coast between Los Angeles and San Francisco. The 229-foot-tall (70-meter) Falcon 9 rocket will fly with a first stage booster reused from a previous NRO mission in February. The booster will return to Vandenberg for an onshore landing about eight minutes after launch, while the rocket\u2019s second stage delivers its top secret cargo into orbit.
