The molecule, called methyl cation (CH3+), is quite unique. The molecule doesn\u2019t react to hydrogen all that efficiently but can react with other common molecules. This reaction allows for the creation and growth of more complex carbon-based molecules\u00a0 \u2014 like life.", "publishedAt": "2023-06-28T18:54:25.000Z", "updatedAt": "2023-06-28T19:04:33.833Z", "featured": false, "launches": [], "events": []}, {"id": 19854, "title": "NASA Offers Media Interviews in Utah on Asteroid Sample Return", "url": "http://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-offers-media-interviews-in-utah-on-asteroid-sample-return", "imageUrl": "https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/osiris-rex-sample-return-capsule-artist-concept.jpg?itok=Kz2oiP6w", "newsSite": "NASA", "summary": "NASA invites media to the U.S. Army\u2019s Dugway Proving Ground about 80 miles southwest of Salt Lake City on Thursday, July 20, before the agency\u2019s first asteroid sample collected in space is returned to Earth.", "publishedAt": "2023-06-28T18:14:00.000Z", "updatedAt": "2023-06-28T18:14:34.797Z", "featured": false, "launches": [], "events": []}, {"id": 19853, "title": "Above: Orbital develops energy for  spacecraft under recent awards", "url": "https://spacenews.com/above-orbital-develops-energy-for-spacecraft-under-recent-awards/", "imageUrl": "https://i0.wp.com/spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rsz_221-0304_voyager_with_approaching_starship.jpg", "newsSite": "SpaceNews", "summary": "Above: Orbital is developing technology to provide energy for on-orbit servicing, assembly and manufacturing with the support of two recent Small Business Innovation Research awards.", "publishedAt": "2023-06-28T18:05:50.000Z", "updatedAt": "2023-06-28T18:14:20.936Z", "featured": false, "launches": [], "events": []}, {"id": 19852, "title": "Startup iRocket wins Space Force contract to demonstrate rocket engine", "url": "https://spacenews.com/startup-irocket-wins-space-force-contract-to-demonstrate-rocket-engine/", "imageUrl": "https://i0.wp.com/spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image001.jpg", "newsSite": "SpaceNews", "summary": "Innovative Rocket Technologies, known as iRocket, won a U.S. Space Force contract to demonstrate a reusable rocket engine for small launch vehicles.", "publishedAt": "2023-06-28T13:04:29.000Z", "updatedAt": "2023-06-28T13:14:20.403Z", "featured": false, "launches": [], "events": []}, {"id": 19851, "title": "Ramon.Space raises $26 million from Foxconn and other backers", "url": "https://spacenews.com/ramon-space-raises-26-million-from-foxconn-and-other-backers/", "imageUrl": "https://i0.wp.com/spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rsz_ramonspace_computing_products.png", "newsSite": "SpaceNews", "summary": "Ramon.Space has raised $26 million from Ingrasys, a subsidiary of Foxconn Technology Group, the Abu Dhabi-based Strategic Development Fund, and venture capital firms.", "publishedAt": "2023-06-28T12:00:00.000Z", "updatedAt": "2023-06-28T12:14:24.378Z", "featured": false, "launches": [], "events": []}]
