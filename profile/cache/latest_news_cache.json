The launch preparations at Kennedy will include loading of more than a ton of xenon gas into the Psyche spacecraft, followed by encapsulation of the probe inside SpaceX\u2019s payload fairing before rolling out to pad 39A for integration with a Falcon Heavy launcher. \u201cShipping to the launch site feels like the home stretch is kind of coming, and it certainly feels that way on Psyche,\u201d said Brian Bone, the lead engineer on Psyche\u2019s assembly, test, and launch operations team. The xenon will fuel the spacecraft\u2019s electric propulsion system, a set of four high-efficiency electric thrusters to guide Psyche from Earth to its namesake asteroid destination. The robotic mission will reach the asteroid Psyche in January 2026, then enter a series of orbits at different distances to map the unexplored world.
